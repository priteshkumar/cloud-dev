## Distributed Systems concepts

> Distributed system is collection of independent components residing on different machines that share messages to achieve a common goal.

* Redundancy - redundancy is about having more than one copy of the data. It helps in avoiding the loss of data due to a new partition or node failure

* Consistency
* Availability
* Partition tolerance
* Scalability
* Concurrency
* Abstraction

### Distributed systems architectures

* Master-slave : MongoDb/MySQL
* Master-master : Cassandra

### Challenges in implementation

* Performance
* Scalability
* Reliability/Fault tolerance
* Security

### Distributed systems solution

* Amazon s3 - storage
* Spark - computation
* Kafka - messaging
* MongoDB - noSQL dbms



### Kafka (distributed fault tolerant message queue)

> Reliable/scalable

> Non blocking applications (decouples producers/consumers)

> Asynchronous applications 

> Streaming Data ingestions 
 

### MongoDB (distributed nosql dbms)

> MongoDB provides flexible document schemas, and its design is change-friendly.

>  It is easy to scale out, and it provides the feature of fast in-place updates.

>   It also provides the feature of auto-sharding.
